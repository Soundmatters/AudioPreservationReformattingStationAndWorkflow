# Physical Treatment of the Archive Original Recording

To assure optimal signal extraction from the archive original recording, the viability of the media, and the saftey of the playback deck, media is checked for conditions that may require treatment prior to transfer.   

Treatments are guided by the AIC Code of Ethics and Guidelines for Practice. [GET. THE LINK]

### Cassette: checklist of common conditions and treatments.   

1. Particulate matter (dust, dirt, etc.):   Surface clean with compressed air, vacuum, non-woven tissue or dry brushes.  
1. Biological contamination (mold, infestations, etc.) :  Stop and alert the Archivist if biological contamination is discovered.  This condition may require out-sourcing for remediation.   
1. Binder failure, Soft Binder Syndrome:  Stop and alert the the Archivist if Soft Binder Syndrome is discovered.  This condition may require out-sourcing for remediation.     
1. Binder failure, Sticky Shed Syndrome:  Follow the treatment procedure outlined in the Ampex Patent, #US6797072 B1, September 28, 2004.  
1. Binder failure, delamination and interlayer adhesion: Stop and alert the the Archivist if  delimitation or interlayer adhesion is discovered. This condition may require out-sourcing for remediation.     
1. Mechanical failure, container:  Replace damaged or non-standard cassette boxes.  
1. Mechanical failure, shell:  Replace damaged, missing or failing pressure pads, slip sheets, hubs, rollers, and shells.  
1. Mechanical failure, tape: Repair breaks, clean and replace failed splices; re-attach detatched leader to the hub.  
1. Print through:  Fast head-to-tail wind; fast tail-to-head rewind.  
1. Tape pack abnormalities:  Manual wind or play wind as needed; allow short-term storage in an archival wind to treat edge damage, twists, folds or other tape deformation caused by poor tape pack and storage.  
1. Record disable :  Remove record-enable tabs from the shell.  


### Open-reel: checklist of common conditions and treatments.

1. Particulate matter (dust, dirt, etc.):   Surface clean with compressed air, vacuum, non-woven tissue or dry brushes.
1. Biological contamination (mold, infestations, etc.):  Stop and alert the Archivist if biological contamination is discovered.  This condition may require out-sourcing for remediation.   
1. Binder failure, Soft Binder Syndrome:  Stop and alert the the Archivist if Soft Binder Syndrome is discovered.  This condition may require out-sourcing for remediation.     
1. Binder failure, Sticky Shed Syndrome:  Follow the treatment procedure outlined in the Ampex Patent, #US6797072 B1, September 28, 2004.  
1. Binder failure, delamination and interlayer adhesion: Stop and alert the the Archivist if  delimitation or interlayer adhesion is discovered. This condition may require out-sourcing for remediation.     
1. Mechanical failure, container:  Replace damaged or non-standard open-reel boxes.   
1. Mechanical failure, reel:  Replace damaged or non-standard reels. 
1. Mechanical failure, tape:  Repair breaks; clean and replace failed splices (dry, oozing, etc.); replace failed or missing leader.
1. Dimensional distortion:  Manual wind, play wind, reverse wind (B-wind) and/or short-term storage in an archival wind to treat edge damage, twists, folds or other tape deformation caused by poor tape pack and shrinkage.   
1. Print-through: Fast head-to-tail wind, fast tail-to-head wind.  
2. Vinegar Syndrome:  Stop and alert the Archivist if Vinegar Syndrome is discovered.  This condition may require out-sourcing for remediation.
